Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 

in Kubernetes allows you to define fine-grained access policies for various resources within your cluster. Here's a breakdown of the possible permissions you can assign in Kubernetes RBAC:

Cluster Roles:

cluster-admin: Provides full access to perform any action within the cluster.
cluster-reader: Grants read-only access to all resources within the cluster.
Custom cluster roles: You can define custom cluster roles tailored to your specific requirements.


Roles:

admin: Grants full access to manage resources within a specific namespace.
edit: Provides read/write access to most resources within a specific namespace, but doesn't allow modification of namespace-wide resources like quotas and limits.
view: Grants read-only access to resources within a specific namespace.
Custom roles: Similar to cluster roles, you can define custom roles specific to a namespace.


Verbs:

get: Allows retrieving information about a resource.
list: Permits listing multiple resources.
watch: Allows continuous monitoring for changes to resources.
create: Grants permission to create new resources.
update: Allows modification of existing resources.
delete: Permits deletion of resources.
Resource Types:

pods: Represents running containers.
services: Represents networking services.
deployments: Represents deployment configurations.
configmaps: Manages configuration data.
secrets: Manages sensitive information.
persistentvolumeclaims: Manages requests for persistent storage.
namespaces: Manages namespaces.
Combining these elements, you can create a wide variety of RBAC configurations to suit your needs. For example:

A user with the cluster-admin role has full control over all resources in the cluster.
A user with a custom role called data-analyst might have permissions limited to get, list, and watch on pods and services within a specific namespace for monitoring purposes.
A service account for a CI/CD system might be granted create, update, and delete permissions for deployments and pods in a staging namespace.
When configuring RBAC in Kubernetes, it's important to follow the principle of least privilege, granting only the permissions necessary for users or services to perform their intended tasks.
